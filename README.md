# IGT-IntegerAdjustment

An adjustment that I made for this World of Warcraft addon created by ashakida.
<br><br>
I was concerned about the fact that his addon wasn't couting my looted gold from instances. So I checked his lua code and I saw that you use a string match for that count. My first test was changing that counting to the way it was showed in portuguese and it worked. But that was not enough. So I changed that part to find integers and works for more languages and then I send this adjustment to him.
